## 3. Extra Features

## 4. Implementation plan for features
* Authentication - Implemented with Django auth
* Payment - external Simple Payments service
* Search and filtering categories - different database queries
* Security - Heroku provides HTTPS, avoiding vulnerabilities in web page inputs (SQL-injection), clean up HTML before using (Cross-site scripting) this is provided mostly by Heroku
* URLs - Python module (Django) which maps URL path expressions to Python functions (Django views)
* Adding games - URL to a file which contains HTML and links to JavaScript files. Game is shown to players via iframe
* Requests - Are handled in views (Django) which fetch objects from the database, modify those objects if needed, render forms, return HTML etc. and return web responses
* Game/Service interaction - done via Ajax calls
* Statistics - combination of basic database (SQL) and JavaScript/Python
